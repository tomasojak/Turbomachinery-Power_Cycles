# Turbomachinery Assignemnt 1
For now, and probably forever, all code will be in the jupyter notebook. This is the original format and features responsive sliders otherwise not (reasonably) possible to implement.

Our assignment is on **Intercooled recuperated** Brayton cycle.

To use this repository:
Probably easiest to use a [git client](https://github.com/apps/desktop), should come with a git installation as well

1) Download [git](https://git-scm.com/install/mac) (seems to be a headache on Mac)
2) In target folder run (should likely work)
```sh
git init
git clone https://github.com/tomasojak/Turbomachinery-Power_Cycles.git
```
3) use git as nromal

Or we can always use something else to share the code if this would waste too much time.
