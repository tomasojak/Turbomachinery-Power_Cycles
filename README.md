# Turbomachinery Assignemnt 1
For now, and probably forever, all code will be in the jupyter notebook. This is the original format and features responsive sliders otherwise not (reasonably) possible to implement.

Our assignment is on **Intercooled recuperated** Brayton cycle.

---

All of the assignment is an an external python file named `IntercooledRecoup.py`.
The logic for plotting (and caing the plots) is in a standalone file.
The Brayton cycle has been moved to a separate file for external plotting capabilities.

The notebook is linked to the external files to retain functionality.
